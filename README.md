GAG (GenericAdventureGame)
is a basic comand line game.
To make it not completely barebones 
i added a feature where it opens an 
image file and shows it on the screen!

Instalation:
  Simply just clone the repo in any directory and make sure you have python installed!

Running the game:
  Run this command:
    python3 '


I hope you like my game, i spent quite the time on it!
