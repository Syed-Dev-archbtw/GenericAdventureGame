GAG (GenericAdventureGame)
is a basic comand line game.
To make it not completely barebones 
i added a feature where it opens an 
image file and shows it on the screen!

Instalation:
 
Simply just clone the repo in any directory and make sure you have python installed!


Running the game:

Run this command for Linux:
{    
clear && python3 'Adventurer RPG WIP.py'
}
Run this command for windows:
{
cls && python 'Adventurer RPG WIP.py'
}


Requirements
Image (install with {pip install Image})

I hope you like my game, i spent quite the time on it!
